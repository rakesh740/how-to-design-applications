# creating a software simple is important

- complex system is hard to understand so not reliable
- hard to add new features
- hard to change existing code
- hard to debug
- hard to test understand by new devs
- hard to test
- creating a solution SIMPLE will take time short term but save time long term

but I dont know how to create simple solution

common mistakes

- implementing too fast without thinking about future complexity  
- closely coupling implementation, interwining interdependent objects
