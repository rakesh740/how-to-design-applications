user devices and payment management?

data ingestion - data transform - data output

protocols - RTMP: good on top of reliable connection

why tcp over udp ? udp faster / tcp reliable ordered

message queue for all the video transformation workers

matrix: all resolution * all encodings

a distributed storage system - amazon S3 to store data

a CDN to deliver video to end user to reduce latency because cdn will be near user and user to server connection is less reliable

HLS / Dash / webRTC for user to cdn connection
