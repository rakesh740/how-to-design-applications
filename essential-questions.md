# essential questions

1. what are the main functionalities for the system
    - users
    - business objectives
2. core engineering principles
    - reliable
    - maintainable
    - scalable
    - caching ?
3. understand the problem from high level (business soulution)
4. from users perspective. (how to give users good UX)

when the system is harder for developers to understand and reason about, hidden assumptions, unintended consequences, and unexpected interactions are more easily overlooked.

## Note

- design system so users want to use the system. applies to all parts of engineering
- design code so it is easy for future devs to maintain - fix bugs, add features, keep it operational

What matters in software is: does the software do what is supposed to do? Is it of high quality? Can we rely on it? Can problems be fixed along the way? Can requirements change over time? The answers to these questions is what matters in writing software not the look and feel of the experience writing the code or the cultural implications of it.
